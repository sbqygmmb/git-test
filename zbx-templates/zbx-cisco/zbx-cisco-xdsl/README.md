Installation
------------

1. Install [`advsnmp.discovery`](https://github.com/simonkowallik/Zabbix-Addons/tree/master/advsnmp.discovery) in the **ExternalScripts** directory of your Zabbix server and/or proxy. Check your `zabbix_server.conf` and/or `zabbix_proxy.conf` if in doubt.
2. Then `chmod a+x advsnmp.discovery`
3. Add a value mapping named `ciscoAdslLineType` with the following values:
  * 1 => noChannel
  * 2 => fastOnly
  * 3 => interleavedOnly
  * 4 => fastOrInterleaved
  * 5 => fastAndInterleaved
4. Add a value mapping named `ciscoAdslLineConfig` with the following values:
  * 1 => other
  * 2 => dmt
  * 3 => cap
  * 4 => qam
5. Import **zbx-cisco-xdsl.xml** file into Zabbix.
6. Add to your host the **{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}** macro with your SNMP community as value.
7. Associate **ZBX-CISCO-xDSL** template to the host.
 
### Requirements

This template was tested for Zabbix 2.0.0 or higher.

###### [advsnmp.discovery](https://github.com/simonkowallik/Zabbix-Addons/tree/master/advsnmp.discovery) 2.0

This template use this script as an alternative to the build-in SNMP low level discovery of Zabbix.
